Lists developer environment requirements for the Propel Developer Challenge

## Devskiller challenges
Propel are currently using the [DevSkiller](https://devskiller.com/) platform as part of the their interview process to evaluate candidates. As part of that evaluation there will be a programming task and it is important that candidates make sure they are appropriately prepared beforehand so they do not waste precious time installing SDKs and the like during the time-boxed test.

The challenges can be edited in the browser (but we have not found that method to have been used effectively) alternatively the challenge can be download/uploaded as a zip file or more commonly using [git](https://git-scm.com/). 

### .NET challenges

.NET Programming Tasks will come with a guide that will look something like this

Candidates should make sure they have the appropriate SDKs installed eg `.net 5`. We also recommend that candidates have an editor they are comfortable with and know how to execute unit tests to help them complete the challenge efficiently. Some common editors are: 

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) which has a Community version (Windows and Macs) that is free for home use
3. [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) which currently has a free 30 day trial
